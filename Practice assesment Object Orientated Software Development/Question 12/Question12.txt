We may define a class variable as being static. Explain, with an example
scenario, why we might do this.

In a static class varible is a veribale that belongs to the class itself 
but not to any instances of the class.

We use static when we want to keep track of information that is related to the
class itself

An example

public class Student {
    private static int numStudents = 0;
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Student(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        numStudents++;
    }

    public static int getNumStudents() {
        return numStudents;
    }
}
