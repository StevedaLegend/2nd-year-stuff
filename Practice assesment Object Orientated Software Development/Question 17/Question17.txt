Why do we sometimes need to use the keyword this in java?


We sometimes use **this** in a java program because its easier to declare 
a variable if its in a constuctor or a method we use **this** to declare 
our variables in a contructor program. 

An example 

public Amoungus(name, age, dateofbirth){

    this.name = name; 
    this.age = age; 
    this.dateofbirth = dateofbirth;
}
