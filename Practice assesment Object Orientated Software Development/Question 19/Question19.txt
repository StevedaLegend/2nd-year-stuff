What might we do inside the finalize() method.

The finalize() method is called the finalizer

This method bring back objects that were in the garbage back to life

Here is an example of how the finalizer might look like in a  java program 

public class Finalizable {
    private BufferedReader reader;

    public Finalizable() {
        InputStream input = this.getClass()
          .getClassLoader()
          .getResourceAsStream("file.txt");
        this.reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(input));
    }

    public String readFirstLine() throws IOException {
        String firstLine = reader.readLine();
        return firstLine;
    }

    // other class members
}
