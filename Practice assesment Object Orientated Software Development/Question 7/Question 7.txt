What is a constuctor?

A constuctor is a class method used to call the main driver program so
you can debug the program itself an example would be 

public Steve(String name, int age, String address, int phonenumber){

    this.name = name; 
    this.age = age;
    this.address = address;
    this.phonenumber = phonenumber;
}

You can use this constuctor to link to a debugger in a class by calling the constructor
name.
